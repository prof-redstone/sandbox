# Sandbox C++ simulation

This is my c++ sanbox simulation made from scratch using only the SFML library for rendering.

Creating custom physics to make different materials with different specs in more detail below.

# Materials :

- sand ğŸŸ¡ ğŸŸ©

- water ğŸ”µ ğŸŸ¦

- stone ğŸŸ¤ ğŸŸ©

- wood ğŸŸ¤ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ§ ğŸŸ©

- salt ğŸŸ¡ â¬œ ğŸŸ©

- oil ğŸ”µ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ§ ğŸŸ©

- lava ğŸ”µ ğŸŸ§

- coal ğŸŸ¡ ğŸŸ¥ ğŸŸ§ ğŸŸ©

- snow ğŸŸ¡ ğŸŸ¦ â¬œ

- ice ğŸŸ¤ ğŸŸ¦ â¬œ

- acid ğŸ”µ

- bedrock ğŸŸ¤

- fire ğŸ”º ğŸŸ§

- airğŸ”º

- steamğŸ”º

- salt-water ğŸ”º

**legend :**

- ğŸ”µ : move like a liquid

- ğŸŸ¤ : solid, dont move by gravity

- ğŸŸ¡ : move like semi-solid or sand

- ğŸ”º : special element with unique properties

- ğŸŸ¥ : can be set on fire and burned

- ğŸŸ¦ : can evaporate with heat

- ğŸŸ© : can be corroded by acid

- ğŸŸ§ : can generate heat and make fire

- â¬œ : can dissolve in water



**special elements :**

- air : empty cell without update

- fire : air with fire set to on, and can propagate heat but dont move or evolve

- steam : is generated when water are heated and go up, after a moment it coldown and come back to water form and raindrop.

- salt-water : produce by dissolving salt in water, when heated it generate steam and salt cell.



**example :**

<img title="" src="img/lava.gif" alt="" width="500">

Lava flow and cooldown into stone.

<img title="" src="img/water_salte.gif" alt="" width="500">

Built water circuit to dissolve salt.

<img title="" src="img/oil_coal_wood_acid_vapor.gif" alt="" width="500">

Oil, wood and coal can be set to fire, and propagate heat, water turn into steam.

Acid destroys stone and organic matter.

<img title="" src="img/ice_snow.gif" alt="" width="500">

Snow and ice melt contact with hot materials such as lava, and turn into water then steam.
